# üõ†Ô∏è Local development

##  Prerequisites

You can follow these instructions to setup a dev environment:

- Install **Node 14.x (LTS)** either [manually](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v14.x/) or using a tool like [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) or [volta](https://volta.sh/) (recommended)
- Install **Meteor** ([version here](apps/meteor/.meteor/release)): https://www.meteor.com/developers/install
- Install **yarn**: https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install
- Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.git`
- Run `yarn` to install dependencies

**Starting Rocket.Chat:**

To install Rocket.Chat with Nginx, MySQL, and an SSL certificate on Ubuntu 22.04, follow these steps:

### 1. **Update the System**
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
   ```

### 2. **Install Required Dependencies**
   ```bash
   sudo apt install -y curl build-essential software-properties-common
   ```

### 3. **Install MongoDB**
   Rocket.Chat uses MongoDB as its primary database.
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://pgp.mongodb.com/server-6.0.asc | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-server-6.0.gpg > /dev/null
   echo "deb [ signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-server-6.0.gpg ] https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu focal/mongodb-org/6.0 multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-6.0.list
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install -y mongodb-org
   sudo systemctl enable mongod --now
   ```

### 4. **Install Node.js**
   Rocket.Chat requires Node.js.
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo -E bash -
   sudo apt install -y nodejs
   ```

### 5. **Install Rocket.Chat**
   ```bash
   sudo mkdir -p /opt/Rocket.Chat
   sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /opt/Rocket.Chat
   cd /opt/Rocket.Chat
   curl -L https://releases.rocket.chat/latest/download -o rocket.chat.tgz
   tar -xvzf rocket.chat.tgz
   rm rocket.chat.tgz
   cd bundle/programs/server
   npm install
   cd ../../..
   ```

### 6. **Create a Systemd Service for Rocket.Chat**
   ```bash
   sudo tee /lib/systemd/system/rocketchat.service << EOF
   [Unit]
   Description=The Rocket.Chat Server
   After=network.target remote-fs.target nss-lookup.target mongod.target

   [Service]
   ExecStart=/usr/bin/node /opt/Rocket.Chat/main.js
   StandardOutput=syslog
   StandardError=syslog
   SyslogIdentifier=rocketchat
   User=rocketchat
   Environment=MONGO_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/rocketchat
   Environment=ROOT_URL=http://localhost:3000
   Environment=PORT=3000
   Restart=always
   RestartSec=10
   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   EOF
   ```

   Then reload the systemd daemon and start Rocket.Chat:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl enable rocketchat --now
   ```

### 7. **Install and Configure Nginx**
   ```bash
   sudo apt install -y nginx
   ```

   Create a new Nginx configuration file for Rocket.Chat:
   ```bash
   sudo tee /etc/nginx/sites-available/rocketchat << EOF
   server {
       listen 80;
       server_name your_domain.com;

       location / {
           proxy_pass http://localhost:3000/;
           proxy_http_version 1.1;
           proxy_set_header Upgrade \$http_upgrade;
           proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
           proxy_set_header Host \$host;
           proxy_set_header X-Real-IP \$remote_addr;
           proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For \$proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
           proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto \$scheme;
           proxy_set_header X-NginX-Proxy true;
           proxy_redirect off;
       }
   }
   EOF
   ```

   Enable the configuration and restart Nginx:
   ```bash
   sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/rocketchat /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/rocketchat
   sudo nginx -t
   sudo systemctl restart nginx
   ```

### 8. **Set Up MySQL**
   Install MySQL and secure the installation:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install -y mysql-server
   sudo mysql_secure_installation
   ```

   Create a MySQL database and user for Rocket.Chat:
   ```bash
   sudo mysql -u root -p
   CREATE DATABASE rocketchat;
   CREATE USER 'rocketchat'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'yourpassword';
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON rocketchat.* TO 'rocketchat'@'localhost';
   FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
   EXIT;
   ```

### 9. **Install Certbot for SSL**
   ```bash
   sudo apt install -y certbot python3-certbot-nginx
   sudo certbot --nginx -d your_domain.com
   ```

   Follow the prompts to obtain and configure the SSL certificate.

### 10. **Final Configuration**
   Update the Rocket.Chat systemd service to include MySQL:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /lib/systemd/system/rocketchat.service
   ```

   Modify the `Environment=MONGO_URL` line if you want to point to MySQL. Since Rocket.Chat uses MongoDB by default, this step may not be necessary unless you intend to manage other related databases with MySQL.

   Reload systemd:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl restart rocketchat
   ```

Rocket.Chat should now be accessible via `https://your_domain.com`.
